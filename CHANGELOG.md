# Changelog

## Version `0.1.1`

Installed and set up DatoCMS source plugin with my DatoCMS read-only API key. Added sample GraphQL query to `index.js` for last five posts. Also prettified `index.js`.

## Version `0.1.0`

Created a blank Gatsby app (no plugins). Replaced `index.js`'s contents with a "coming soon" placeholder message–linked to [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/thiagovilla89), at least 😎. Then installed the GitHub pages and Google Analytics plugins. Added GitHub's `CNAME` file with my domain `thiagovilla.com` to the `/static` folder. Also set up the GA plugin with my tracking ID.
