# Creative Process

## Initial idea

I always [start with why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action), but a personal website is ~almost~ a must since [I work in IT](https://linkedin.com/in/thiagovilla89). Some of the reasons are branding, portfolio, and job hunting. At this point, this website's goal is to **promote myself as a software engineer**--I feel I need something more laser-focused, but that suffices for now. Future goals might include selling digital products, getting freelance work, or finding co-founders.

Another related and overarching objective is for this website to be a place where I can **"be myself" online**. There is so much you can design or write on other media like [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com), [Medium](https://medium.com), and [Wordpress](https://linkedin.com); they have their own dress code and invevitably limit your creative choices. Also, in SEO terms, content I publish elsewhere only add to the owner's domain authority ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I _do_ want to write guest posts, though.

So, to address these two goals, my initial idea is: a blog with tutorial posts (no content marketing plan yet), section for code snippets, portfolio, about page, contact form and social media handles. I would like to place activity feeds in the footer (Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub). An idea for the future is to have an online indicator for when I'm on Slack or Discord. I would like to design it in Gatsby, since I'm already using Jekull on Devs Jungle and Hugo on ALEIN.
