# Creative Process

## Initial idea

I always [start with why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action), but a personal website is _almost_ a no-brainer, more so because [I work in IT](https://linkedin.com/in/thiagovilla89). Some of the reasons are branding, portfolio, and job hunting. At this point, this website's goal is to **promote myself as an IT employee**--I feel I need something more laser-focused than "IT employee," but that suffices for now. Other goals I might pursue in the future are to sell digital products, get freelance work, or find co-founders.

One other related and overarching objective for this website is to be a place where I can make creative choices and **"be myself" online**. There is so much you can design or write on other media like [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com), [Medium](https://medium.com), and [Wordpress](https://linkedin.com); they have their own dress codes. Also, in SEO terms, content I publish elsewhere only add to the owner's domain authority ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I _do_ want to write guest posts, though.
